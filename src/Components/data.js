        She was the easiest person I have known/met, so giving of herself. So easy to talk to, she has a way of nudging you to the right direction with her words. Her Sprituality is worth emulating, wanting everyone to take the truth seriously. Oh! Her sisterly advice which I will forever cherish. Her heart is big enough to offer individual attention to everyone, which I benefited from. Her KINDNESS and POSITIVITY will leave an unwavering chapter in my life. Your death still has not changed anything. Your kind words, your sound advice, your generosity will forever remain in my heart. Memories is what I have remaining of u, which we created and shared. So my dear till we meet again when Jehovah will call and you will answer, YOU are forever LOVED

        I remember so much of the time spent been around her and there has not been a dull moment.. Very jovial and caring.. She administers correction in a calm and loving way... And that's partly one of the reasons she's lived so much. Above all else she loves Jehovah and his ways and is very visible in the patterns and ways of young Timothy and Lydia as they also love the truth... And As a wife, I can bodly say she loved an atmosphere of peace and that's very visible in the way bro adeosun and she herself lived ...they were always close together hardly separable ,,,she had wonderful qualities that I can bodly say as uncle Paul can also confirm to the fact that she was his perfect wife material.. She will sure be missed...as I also will miss been called uncle Gennis by a name given to me by my very own young Timothy....aunty uzu always had a peaceful home in which whenever im around them I also feel the love in the family she was a capable wife who always puts her family first. We truely would miss her...for time would run out if I were to keep speaking of how wonderful she is ...but she'd forever be in our loving memory.

A spiritual sister, always ready and willing to jump on the next spiritual assignment or endeavour. The many spiritually stimulating conversations we had were so refreshing, Uzuazor was warm and very practical but always sought to see and address things Jehovah’s way.`

        I personally benefited from her kind gesture and hospitality and I always imagined having a peaceful home like she made hers to be, she wasn't selfish even with sharing her family time with others, she was always welcoming.
        
        She was a woman of faith, it was clear how much she loved Jehovah and she had so much zeal in the ministry. I saw how happy she was each time we went out in service.
        It's sad to write this but my heart is breaking for this deep loss. Such a beautiful and loving sister who will now be kept solid in Jehovahs memory.

She was humble, driven, and passionate about God.Her godly advice helped me a great deal when I was going through some rough times maritally.

It was just 7months Uzu, but it felt like I had known you for a very long time. Thank you for the sisterly talks and wisdom... It worked. But I will miss you my dear friend.Rest in God's bossom Sis.`

        Shakespeare said, "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
        And then is heard no more. It is a tale
        Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
        Signifying nothing......"
        Your untimely death is a big blow to us all that knew you. I'm personally yet to come to terms with the brutal fact that you're dead; that you're no more.
        Your death has thrown hundreds of us, particularly the Unique Friends Schools family into untold agony, tears, pains and gloom.
        We wish we could turn back the hands of time for you to come back and properly prepare us, your dear husband, Lydia and Timothy for a life without you before this transition but God takes the glory for everything.
        We will take solace in the legacies you have left behind after your very short stay here!

        She was a good mother to her children and did her best to raise them in the truth.
        
        Her comments at the meetings were not only meaningful and upbuilding but also a source of encouragement to others.
        
        Despite being in enormous pain during the last few days of her life, she displayed strength of character, endurance, positive spirit and was singing kingdom songs all through this trying period until she breathed her last.

The precious moments we shared during the territory seldom work are memories I would never trade for any other thing. Working side by side with her in the field ministry has truly proved to very inciting for me. Her zealousness in serving Jehovah is a wonderful quality I truly admire. her strong appreciation for our spiritual heritage are obviously even seen in both Lydia and Timothy. Her undeniable acts of generosity and her spirit of hospitality are actions that are deeply ingrained in her heart. Jehovah knows these, and for a certainty, she will rise again! She will rise again in a world filled with peace and good health, to a life of eternity, a world where the sting of death will become powerless!`

        Memories of our times together still feels so fresh in my mind that the news of your death left me so devastated and with so much sadness that I can't express in words.
        
        Uzuazor Adeosun you were a rare gem with a heart of gold, she always brought out the best in people around her.
        
         We've always been each other's cheerleader. She always shared the good things happening in her life with me and vice versa! I remembered when we had our first babies and she bought a washing machine, she called me up and off we went to buy mine, when she bought new sets of cooking utensils, she told me to buy the exact same thing because it will last for me and guess what, I am still using them after all these years. We both went to learn jewelry (wire work) even though we never made one naira out of it. 
        And then I wanted you to start pioneering together with me..... Time will fail me to mention all the things we said and did together 
        
        We had so many dreams and plans we intend to do together, talking about where we want to go, do and the things we want to see... What distance can not do, death has succeeded in doing it, separating close friends .
        
        I am distressed over you, my sister Uzuazor; You were very dear to me.
        
        But Jehovah's assurance is enough for me, seeing you again in perfect health is a reality with eyes of Faith.

        It's hard for me to pen these words because in my heart you're still here, however I must write them for me to always read because it reminds me of our life (as your name implies) together.
        
        I recall our childhood days when we used to eat together- we were the slowest eaters in the house. 
        
        I recall when mummy first enrolled you in Ebenezer Primary School, you said you didn't want to go to school, you cried and begged that your school uniform should be given to Esther (our late cousin)
        I recall our days in secondary school, how we take  the bus To and Fro everyday and sometimes how we trekked.....
        
        Oh I recalled the best of them all...when we got baptized on Saturday 21, 1995 it was the best day of our lives.
        
        I recall when you got married and when you you gave birth to Lilly girl and Tim boy as I fondly call them.
        
        I recall all our laughters, cries, jokes, quarrels , and settlement ,plans,plans and plans...
        I recall all our encouraging words to each other and how we discuss, analyze and appreciate the scriptures, publications ,our organization, Jehovah and Jesus. 
        
        I can go on and on....
        To say I miss you is an understatement but what keeps me going is knowing that Jehovah will not stop loving us if our life should end, and that you are in his memory as if you're alive.

        tribute: `Sister Uzuazo was one of our dearest and beloved sister in the congregation, she was focussed on spiritual things, she showed spiritual pursuits, she was a Friend, a calm, loving, humble, quiet, peaceful sister, loves Jehovah spiritually minded, always in the ministry irrespective of her busy schedule, our heart bleeds over her sudden departure but Jehovah the God of all comfort will comfort us as we have the hope of resurrection. She showed by her words and actions that Jehovah is the most important person to her and Jehovah will remember. `

        We all take solace in Jehovah’s promise which surely will not fail.  May Jehovah console the family of Adeoshun and Omueda families. 
We look forward to a time when no one will say “I am sick.” When Jehovah will “swallow up death.”Isa. 25:8
